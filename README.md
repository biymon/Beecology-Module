[comment]:[![N|Solid](https://cldup.com/dTxpPi9lDf.thumb.png)](https://nodesource.com/products/nsolid)

### Introduction
Beecology Web Services is a method of communication between client end and server end over the web. Client end(Android, iOS, browser end/applications) can operate the Web servcies API to process the database distributed on server indirectly.
  - Keep the central database from remote access or attacks.
  - Clearly 

Markdown is a lightweight markup language based on the formatting conventions that people naturally use in email.  As [John Gruber] writes on the [Markdown site][df1]

> The overriding design goal for Markdown's
> formatting syntax is to make it as readable
> as possible. The idea is that a
> Markdown-formatted document should be
> publishable as-is, as plain text, without
> looking like it's been marked up with tags
> or formatting instructions.


### Technology

Beecology Web Services uses following programming language and frameworks to work properly:

* [PHP](http://php.net/) - a server scripting language for writing web pages.
    * *current version: 7.0.22*
* [Slim3](https://www.slimframework.com/) - a PHP micro framework for building web applications and API.
* [Swagger-UI](https://swagger.io/swagger-ui/) - a framework for writing APIs documentation.

The source of Beecology Web Service distributed on [GitLab](http://)
[API Documentation](http://beecology.wpi.edu/rest/vendor/api_v1) is an instruction of how to operate Beecology Web Service for developers.
